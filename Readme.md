# Chris J's Simple Calculator.
## The Goal
This program will use tkinter to create a GUI program that does simple calculations.
## Roadmap:

### Phase 1 (Started October 8 2024)
1. TKinter GUI interface will be created in this phase to create a calculator. (Completed Oct 8 2024)
2. Interface is customized to look prettier (Completed Oct 9 2024)

### Phase 2 (Started October 9 2024)
1. Actual calculator functionality implemented
    - map buttons to a "command" function that will do different things based on the button pressed
    - implement a buffer that holds a value. The buffer is acted upon by the button functions
    - update the display of the calculator every time the buffer value is changed.
